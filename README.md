## Neural Network from Scratch

This is a minimal implementation of a fully connected neural network in two languages i.e. Python and C++.

> This project uses matplotlib-cpp, a lightweight C++ wrapper for the popular Python Matplotlib library. It allows the C++ engine to 'bridge' into Python to generate high-quality plots of neural network training metrics.
